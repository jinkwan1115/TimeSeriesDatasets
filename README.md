# TimeSeriesDatasets
This repository offers a collection of descriptions and download links for datasets related to Time Series Analysis, including tasks like forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection.

## Datasets(Benchmarks) for Time Series Forecasting

## Datasets(Benchmarks) for spatio-temporal analysis

## Datasets(Benchmarks) for Time Series Anomaly Detection
- **Secure Water Treatment(SWaT) dataset** - need to request dataset access from iTrust Labs
    - https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#swat
    - This dataset is collected from a real-world water treatment plant with 7 days of normal and 4 days of abnormal operation
    - This dataset consists of sensor values (water level, flow rate, etc.) and actuator operations (valves and pumps)

- **Water Distribution(WADI) dataset** - also need to request dataset access from iTrust Labs
    - This is an extension of the SWaT system but had more than twice the number of sensors and actuators than the SWaT model
    - The dataset is also collected for a longer duration of 14 and 2 days of normal and attack scenarios

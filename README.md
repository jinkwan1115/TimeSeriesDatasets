## Datasets for Spatio-Temporal Analysis

## Datasets for Time Series Anomaly Detection
- **Secure Water Treatment(SWaT) dataset**
    - You need to request dataset access from iTrust Labs(https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#swat)
    - This dataset is collected from a real-world water treatment plant with 7 days of normal and 4 days of abnormal operation
    - This dataset consists of sensor values (water level, flow rate, etc.) and actuator operations (valves and pumps)

- **Water Distribution(WADI) dataset**
    - You also need to request dataset access from iTrust Labs(https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#swat)     
    - This is an extension of the SWaT system but had more than twice the number of sensors and actuators than the SWaT model
    - The dataset is also collected for a longer duration of 14 and 2 days of normal and attack scenarios

- **Soil Moisture Active Passive(SMAP) dataset**
    - https://nsidc.org/data/smap/data
    - Soil samples and telemetry information using the Mars rover by NASA
    - Integrated with Mars Science Laboratory(MSL) dataset in https://github.com/khundman/telemanom
    - You can get the public datasets (SMAP and MSL) on linux:
      ```
      wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/telemanom/data.zip && unzip data.zip && rm data.zip
      cd data && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khundman/telemanom/master/labeled_anomalies.csv
      ```
    - Please refer to https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly/blob/master/data_preprocess.py for preprocessing

- **Mars Science Laboratory(MSL) dataset**
    - Similar to SMAP, but corresponds to the sensor and actuator data for the Mars rover itself
    - However, this dataset is known to contain many trivial sequences, with three non-trivial ones (A4, C2 and T1)

- **Server Machine Dataset(SMD)**
    - This is a five-week long dataset of stacked traces of the resource utilizations of 28 machines from a compute cluster
    - This dataset includes non-trivial sequences, specifically the traces named machine-1-1, machine-2-1, machine-3-2, and machine-3-7

    - A dataset of multiple real-world data traces, including readings from temperature sensors, CPU utilization of cloud machines, service request latencies and taxi demands in New York city
    - However, this dataset is known to have sequences with incorrect anomaly labels such as the nyc-taxi trace (must exclude)
    - Real data
        - realAWSCloudwatch
            - AWS server metrics as collected by the AmazonCloudwatch service. Example metrics include CPU Utilization, Network Bytes In, and Disk Read Bytes

                - Temperature sensor data of an internal component of a large, industrial machine
                - The first anomaly is a planned shutdown of the machine
                - The second anomaly is difficult to detect and directly led to the third anomaly, a catastrophic failure of the machine
            - nyc_taxi.csv
                - Number of NYC taxi passengers, where the five anomalies occur during the NYC marathon, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years day, and a snow storm
